# SNPcode

## A genetic variation-based approach to barcoding for cell-to-embryo identification. 

`SNPcode` is a tool that can be used to simulate SNP profiles over a pool of cells belonging to an arbitrary number of embryos. This tool is an proof of concept that will be instrumental for establishing the use of SNP profiles as intrinsic barcodes.

## Motivation

The current experimental framework for scRNA-seq timecourse studies is being rapidly outpaced by the computational methods being developed to carry out downstream tasks such as cell trajectory inference. Given that such limitations in throughput will consequently limit the resolution that can be achieved, there is a growing need to improve the scale of existing experimental paradigms.
